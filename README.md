# Adjourn

Adjourn is an ncurses-based interface to [jrnl](http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/).

The functionality is incomplete. You can however view a journal in a
basic way with `adjourn path/to/jrnl.txt [--decrypt]`.

To install:
- Download & install stack from https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack
- Clone this repo
- Run `stack build` and then `stack install`
