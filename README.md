# Adjourn

Adjourn is an ncurses-based interface to [jrnl](http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/).

The functionality is very incomplete but is being actively working
on. You can however view an unencrypted journal and its contents with
`adjourn jrnl.txt`.

The project should eventually mature into a viewer supporting multiple
kinds of data, not just jrnl's.
